# TF2 Script To Alias Writer

Simply takes a string of text in a file (hopefully with pause breaks like periods
and commas), usually a script from a movie, and allows you to post it in chat!

## How 2 Install/Download:

1. Head to the right, under releases
2. click on the latest version number
3. click on the one that has a kilobyte size, file extension ending, .exe usually,
as the Source code prompts simply give you the source code from the developers who
just made the release of the program.

## How 2 Use

Theres a few ways to use it, the simplest way to use it though is to simply drag
a text file you want to convert it from and it will simply create an autoexec.cfg
file its in.

for more complicated uses though, the arguments typically via the terminal can be
this:

1. The file to convert from
2. The config file to put to, along with the name (usually your tf2's cfg directory
with autoexec.cfg added at the end)
3. The name of the aliases (normally named 'scpt')
4. The delay between text messages (normally at 1450 to prevent server hiccups)

### Using it in TF2

In order to invoke it, simply type `scpt0` in console to activate it! Bind this
to a key to keep it handy if you want. During the sequence, it will show you what
alias its on so you dont feel like you are stuck in an endless loop and instead for
a very long time! You can change the alias by renaming it yourself in the .cfg file
or add a 3rd argument to the terminal.
